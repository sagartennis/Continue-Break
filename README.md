# Continue-Break

The continue method will keep the loop going once the statement is met. 

The Break Statement on the other hand will break out of the loop as soon as the condition is met. 

## PROBLEM - CONTINUE ##

print all the numbers that are odd from 1 - 20. 

## PROBLEM - BREAK ## 

if the program prints the numbers from 1 - 20, and letâ€™s say the break statement must be executed at when the variable is == 6.
